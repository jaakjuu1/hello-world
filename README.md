# hello-world

// Hi I am a earth explorer, wanting to reach a skill set that I can make my community proud. 
I've started this journey a long time ago but could not get near anyone who could be the one to guide me forward. 
Or maybe it's just my personal mindset that is holding me back. I am quite bad taking advice from anyone and the other thing is that I am lazy as a Koala. But I've come to a place where smoking weed does not give me anything but great paranoia and the result of that is that I need to become a great coder to gain some income. 
I may know now what that Jordan Peterson is talking about. I even bought a self guide but could not even finish that.
